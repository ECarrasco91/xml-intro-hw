## Introduction

> ***Note*** _You can help each other, but everyone must hand in their own code._

 Imagine you are a data specialist for a movie theater. You have been asked to store the information about the movies you show in an XML file for the office manager. The file must meet particular criteria so read below for guidance on creating your data file.   

## Exercise

#### Requirements

Create a file called `movies.xml` that includes the following:

- The parent element of the file should be "movie_collection" with the prefix "collection" and the namespace "http://movies.com"
- The "movie_collection" element should have at least 4 "movie" child elements
- Each movie must have attributes for id, title, and description
- Each movie must have a child element called "showtimes", and it should contains at least 3 relevant showtime showtime elements (make something up)
- Each movie should also have 2 empty elements (name them anything you like)

#### Starter code

There is no starter code!  Please create a new file and add your xml code. You can edit in IntelliJ if you like, or just use a simple text editor.

#### Deliverable

A pull request including your xml file.
